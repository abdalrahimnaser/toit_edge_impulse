# Template repository for deploying Edge Impulse C++ Models on Toit-enabled devices


This repository contains a simple example of a Toit envelope with a C service.

The C service is using the qrcode component to generate QR codes, making that
functionality available to Toit programs.

This repository was cloned from this [template](https://github.com/toitlang/template-custom-envelope).
